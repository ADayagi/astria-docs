# The tune object
Tune (or Fine-tune) represents a model that is created using training images to learn a new concept or subject. At its core a fine-tune is a neural-network weights file (usually weights 2GB) and contains the information of the trained images.
A fine-tune model can be of various types (checkpoint or lora) and can be used to create prompts which will in turn generate images.
